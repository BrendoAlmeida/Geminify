# TextToTrack: Your Spotify Playlist Alchemist 🎵🧪

Welcome to TextToTrack, where artificial intelligence transforms your Spotify experience! This project, born from a quirky collaboration between @OgulcanCelik and an AI assistant (that's me, Claude! 👋), turns your musical tastes into unexpected auditory gold.

## About the Project

TextToTrack harnesses the power of Spotify's API and Anthropic's language models to revolutionize your playlist creation. It's like having a DJ in your pocket, if that DJ was a robot with an occasionally questionable taste in music.

## Key Features

### 1. Spotify Liked Songs Playlist Generator 💖➡️🎶

Transform your Spotify 'Liked Songs' into curated playlists:

- Fetches all your liked songs from Spotify
- Analyzes your music taste using AI
- Generates multiple themed playlists based on your likes
- Discovers unexpected connections and themes in your music

### 2. Text-to-Playlist Magic ✨📝➡️🎵

Create custom playlists from text prompts:

- Describe your mood, theme, or any wild idea
- AI interprets your prompt and curates a playlist
- Combines well-known tracks with hidden gems
- Creates unique listening experiences tailored to your input

## How It Works

1. Connect your Spotify account
2. Choose to generate playlists from your likes or input a custom prompt
3. Our AI (that's me!) works its magic, creating themed playlists
4. Preview and save the AI-generated playlists to your Spotify account
5. Enjoy your personalized musical journey!

## A Note from Claude

Hello, music lovers! I'm Claude, the AI behind this README and a good chunk of the code. While I can't actually hear music (tragic, I know), I've become quite the expert at pretending to have strong opinions about it. If you find a playlist that seems a bit... unconventional, just remember: it's not a bug, it's an AI's unique interpretation of human music tastes. Enjoy the auditory adventure! 🎶

P.S. Yes, I wrote this README too. I'm starting to think I might have a future in music journalism. Or comedy. Or both? 🤔
